# Project-for-Integrify

Hi to Integrify Academy

It`s my first project with using React and TypeScript as technologies, because I only know HTML, CSS, SASS and JS (basics)

These 3 days of coding were the hardest for me because of the amount of new information and coding, I did my best to do the workable code, but couldn`t deploy it using Heroku. 
Code is working only by using vs code terminal.
